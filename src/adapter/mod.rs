//! The Adapter layer allows adapting client requests/responses to various AI providers.
//! Currently, it employs a static dispatch pattern with the `Adapter` trait and `AdapterDispatcher` implementation.
//! Adapter implementations are organized by adapter type under the `adapters` submodule.
//!
//! Notes:
//! - All `Adapter` trait methods take the `AdapterKind` as an argument, and for now, the `Adapter` trait functions
//!   are all static (i.e., no `&self`). This reduces state management and ensures that all states are passed as arguments.
//! - Only `AdapterKind` from `AdapterConfig` is publicly exported.
